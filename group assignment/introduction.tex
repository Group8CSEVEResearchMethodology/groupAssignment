\section{Background}
Uganda has experienced a rapid increase of area covered by mobile phone service. As the information flow increases due to the mobile phone coverage expansion, the cost in crop marketing and finding quality produce is still a challenge, particularly more so in remote areas. This is mostly because of ignorance about existing markets for the produce. This leads to price fluctuations, value loss of the produce as some of them are perishable and poor yields.
Therefore, there is a need for more reliable, efficient and automated system to help farmers in finding markets for produce and competitive markets for the buyers of high quality produce. This report describes the product functionality for Lusuku Mobile App system. This document is intended to be used by the members of the project team and project mentor as a monitoring tool to evaluate user satisfaction, check whether it’s addressing the users’ challenges as intended.
