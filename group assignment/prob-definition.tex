\chapter{Problem Definition}

In Uganda price volatility affects several agricultural commodity markets, causing farmers especially at the bottom of the pyramid suffer great loses and prompting buyers to source high quality produce from foreign markets. Therefore, farmers experience challenges in accessing suitable markets for their produce at acceptable prices and the buyerâ€™s main challenge is failure to access high quality produce and finding a competitive market.
While existing market information systems have provided a solution to accessing pricing information, price fluctuations and low-quality produce have continued to affect agricultural incomes.
It is therefore for this reason that group eight has come up with Lusuku mobile to address market accessibility, price fluctuation and high-quality produce challenges through provision of a competitive platform for buyer-seller interaction.
