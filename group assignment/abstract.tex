\begin{abstract}

Agricultural marketing information systems in Uganda have traditionally addressed the accessibility to pricing information, overlooking the fluctuations in the quality of market produce and market prices. Therefore, there is need for a more reliable, efficient and automated system to help farmers and buyers in finding information on the marketing and accessing high quality produce.
"Lusuku mobile" seeks to address the above issue by means of mitigating the risk of poor quality, price fluctuation and market accessibility of agricultural produce.
System analysis was done by "group eight" members to ascertain user and system requirements. Requirements collection was done through review of related literature, observation, and interview of potential end users like the farmers themselves and buyers.
The solution has been designed and implemented by our mobile app to physically realize the impact of our objectives.
Lusuku mobile works with mobile phones that are running on an android platform.
In summary Lusuku mobile is aimed at providing famers with a reliable market and buyers with market information and high-quality produce which we believe is cost effective for all stakeholders.
